# ðŸŽ“ Built a Model for Student Performance with Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to build a model that understand and predict student academic outcomes based on various learning-related features for new and existing dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Classify students as likely to **perform well (Outcome = 1)** or **not perform well (Outcome = 0)**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Features
- Study method  
- Satisfaction level  
- Study time  
- Ability  
- Previous performance

## ðŸ¤– Models Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes (NB)**

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation
### ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Accuracy: **67%**
- Shows better generalization and performance

### ðŸ”¹ Naive Bayes (NB)
- Accuracy: **58%**
- Lower predictive power compared to SVM

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion
- **SVM outperformed Naive Bayes** on this dataset.
- Can be used to identify students at risk of poor performance.
- **Note:** Model improvement is Needed/possible like 95%-100%  â€” higher accuracy would lead to more reliable predictions.
